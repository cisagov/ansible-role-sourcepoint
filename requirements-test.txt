# With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
# identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
# OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
# Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
# 2.10 or newer.

=======
# With the release of molecule v5 there were some breaking changes so
# we need to pin at v5 or newer. However, v5.0.0 had an internal
# dependency issue so we must use the bugfix release as the actual
# lower bound.
